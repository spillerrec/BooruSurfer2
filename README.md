BooruSurfer2
============

BooruSurfer2 is a remake of BooruSurfer, however ported from PHP to C++. The goal of BooruSurfer is to provide a consistent and space-efficient interface to Booru-like image boards, using a web browser as front end. BooruSurfer2 attempts to improve performance in parallel situations, where PHP showed to be impractical. Furthermore, it attempts to integrate a personal image collection into the experience.

NOTE: Still very much work in progress
